# Instructions on how to build and run the solution

Clone the Repo to your local computer

In terminal / git bash/ other command line interfaces, make your way to the folder
Tuum_test_2024_spring

First, make sure you have Node and NPM downloaded, you can check it using 'npm --version' (or node --version)
If not, you can do it here: https://nodejs.org/en/ 

Now you can run in terminal:
'npm install react-scripts'

and finally run:
'npm start'

The application should be running.

## Explanation of important choices for implementation and technologies in the solution

I decided to use React and Typescript. For the main part, it is pretty straight-forward using basic css and html, just combined with Typescript. For adding the flags, I decided to use react-flags-select to display the countries and flags. I chose it because it was already made and was easy to implement. The downside was that I couldn't manage to change the 'Country' input field style to match the others.

## Analysis on what impacts your bundle size the most and what youâ€™ve done (or can do) to optimise it

One thing that certainly impacts my bundle size is the use of big libraries like react. To make the bundle smaller, I tried to use only specific parts of the library. I also tried to avoid code duplication, for example in css files. Another factor contributing	to the bundle size may be the react-flags-select module. It may be possible to just use parts of it swell to avoid importing it whole. One way to make the bundle smaller would also to choose just a few countries and flags and just a smaller selection from there.
